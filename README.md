# Hardware Acceleration of AI

## Overview
This is the repository for University of Toronto course ECE1718 Hardware Acceleration of AI. There are three projects in this repository. 

In the first project, we explored several ways of leveraging existing hardware accelerators in order to speed up a handwritten digit recognition neural network model. We worked with SIMD instruction sets and also fixed-function accelerator using hardware descriptive language (HDL). Details and results can be seen in asgmnt1_report (https://github.com/chengyih001/UofT_ECE1718/blob/main/asgmnt1_report.pdf). 

In the second project, we utilized Matlab Simulink to design accelerators for running on FPGAs. We worked around building neural network blocks and custom adder/multiplier units.  Details and results can be seen in asgmnt1_report (https://github.com/chengyih001/UofT_ECE1718/blob/main/asgmnt2_report.pdf). 

In the third project, we focused on hardware acceleration techniques on GPUs with OpenVX, OpenCV, and CUDA. We accelerated SRCNN inferencing process on NVIDIA GPUs and explored various versions of the model. Details and results can be seen in asgmnt1_report (https://github.com/chengyih001/UofT_ECE1718/blob/main/asgmnt3_report.pdf).
